# ActiveLoginDemos

These are unoffical demos for Active Login. Don't use these in production in any way. They are here to show technical / architechture things and are not supposed to be used for real.

See [https://github.com/ActiveLogin/](https://github.com/ActiveLogin/) or [ActiveLogin.net](https://activelogin.net#support) for more details on Active Login.

## ActiveLoginDemos.ConsoleFlowSample

This demo uses the core packager for ActiveLogin.Authentication and shows how the flows works by implementing BankID in a Console Application.
___Note:___ Don't do this as the certificate is exposed to the computer running the console application. The app is indented as a sample to understand the flow for developers of Active Login.
